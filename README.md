# Couchreq
Couchreq was made to quickly handle some basic CouchDB operations via Python code, without the need for more heavy-duty libraries like [python-cloudant](https://github.com/cloudant/python-cloudant) or [couchdb-python](https://github.com/djc/couchdb-python). 

It is meant to speed up tinkering with CouchDB in new projects, not to be used in production. Oh, and the name Couchreq comes from [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) and [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests).

## What it can do?
### With CouchDB admin rights:

- create new database
  - `create_db(dbname)`
- delete existing database
  - `delete_db(dbname)`
  - **IMPORTANT!** Be sure you want to delete, as this function just deletes db with no questions asked.

### Without CouchDB admin rights:

- create a new document to a database
  - `create_doc(dbname, docdata, docid=None)`
  - give your own id for new document or use one generated by CouchDB
  - docdata is python dictionary
- delete a document from database
  - `delete_doc(dbname, docid)`
- get document from database by id
  - `get_doc(dbname, docid)`
- check if database exists
  - `db_exists(dbname)`
- check if document exists
  - `doc_exists(dbname, docid)`
- list all database names
  - `all_dbs()`
- get revision aka`_rev`-field in a document
  - `get_revision(dbname, docid)`
- get new uuid from CouchDB
  - `get_uuid()`
  
## Requirements
- python 3
- [requests](https://github.com/requests/requests) v. 2.20.0

## Basic usage 
You can insert your admin username and password to `config.json`. Also if you would like to use different url or port for your requests, it can be done in config.json as well. 

### Basic code example:
```
from couchreq import couchreq
creq = couchreq.Couchreq()
doc = creq.get_doc('exampledb', '123456789')
```
